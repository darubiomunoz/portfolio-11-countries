<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## 1. About The Project :round_pushpin:

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]
![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot-frontend]
![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot-mobile]

This project is all about consuming an ***API of countries*** and their particular information that I'll display in two pages. Also I have to be able to search for any specific country and filter them by different categories.

In terms of challenges that I'm trying to overcome in this project are implementing hooks I haven't implemented before in other projects, that's because I just finished a course on ***React Hooks*** specifically so I want to use more hooks and probably making my own ***custom hooks*** :smile:.

Also I want to ***use styled components*** which I haven't never implemented or studied however I want to push myself a little bit and learn by doing, researching, reading documentation, and asking.

Finally I want to use Redux Thunk to make asynchronous logic inside ***Redux*** :stars:.

## 6. What I learned :mortar_board:

This section will be filled at the end of the project.

<!-- Well, as I expected, implementing Redux by myself for the first time was really confusing even when a made a course about **Redux**. I spend so much time trying to learn about Redux and its environment, the learning curve it's actually quite long because it isn't only Redux if not **React Redux**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Redux Thunk** that I didn't used in this project but I will in the next personal project so that I dive more into the understand of Redux.

**I struggle a lot using Redux toolkit** at first, but later in the project I found the biggest wall that was **writing the reducer functions** inside of the store's slices to filter the list of job offers by categories. I was able to find a way to finish the reducer function by **reading much of the Redux and Redux Toolkit documentation**, **reading some articles** I found on the internet, and **searching on google a lot**.

These are some fractions of code where I struggled and came up with solutions.

```
  const initialState = {
    isActive: false,
    roles: [],
    levels: [],
    languages: [],
    tools: [],
  };
```

```
  filterByRoles: (state, action) => {
      const { roles } = action.payload;
      
      if (roles.length > 0) return state.filter((joboffer) => roles.includes(joboffer.role));
    },
    filterByLevels: (state, action) => {
      const { levels } = action.payload;

      if (levels.length > 0) return state.filter((joboffer) => levels.includes(joboffer.level));
    },
    filterByLanguages: (state, action) => {
      const { languages } = action.payload;

      if (languages.length > 0) return state.filter(joboffer => languages.every(item => joboffer.languages.includes(item)));
    },
    filterByTools: (state, action) => {
      const { tools } = action.payload;

      if (tools.length > 0) return state.filter(joboffer => tools.every(item => joboffer.tools.includes(item)));
    }
  }
```

```
  const handleDeleteFilter = (event) => {
    const category = event.target.parentNode.firstChild.firstChild.data;

    dispatch(deleteCategory({ category }));

    dispatch(noFiltersApplied());

    if (!roles.includes(category) && roles.length > 0) dispatch(filterByRoles({ roles }));
    if (!levels.includes(category) && levels.length > 0) dispatch(filterByLevels({ levels }));
    if (!languages.includes(category) && languages.length > 0)
      dispatch(filterByLanguages({ languages }));
    if (!tools.includes(category) && tools.length > 0)
      dispatch(filterByTools({ tools }));
  };
