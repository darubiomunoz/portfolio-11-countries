<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## 1. About The Project :round_pushpin:

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]
![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot-frontend]
![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot-mobile]

As I write this README file, I'm starting this project and I'm very excited because It's the first time I'm applying Redux to one of my personal projects :stars:

I believe it's going to be difficult at first but I'm sure I can find a way to make it until the end of the project successfully with the help of my usual strategy search-read-ask :smile:

Also I'll be adding two sections to my README from now and on at final stage of the project to tell my experience about **What I learned** and **Continued Development**.

  ```

### Installation  :exclamation:

1. Install create-react-app globally in your device
   ```sh
    npm install -g create-react-app
   ```
   ```sh
    yaml install -g create-react-app
   ```

2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/darubiomunoz/portfolio-10-joblistingwithfiltering.git
   ```
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:darubiomunoz/portfolio-10-joblistingwithfiltering.git
   ```

<!-- WHAT I LEARNED -->
<!--
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

## 6. What I learned :mortar_board:

Well, as I expected, implementing Redux by myself for the first time was really confusing even when a made a course about **Redux**. I spend so much time trying to learn about Redux and its environment, the learning curve it's actually quite long because it isn't only Redux if not **React Redux**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Redux Thunk** that I didn't used in this project but I will in the next personal project so that I dive more into the understand of Redux.

**I struggle a lot using Redux toolkit** at first, but later in the project I found the biggest wall that was **writing the reducer functions** inside of the store's slices to filter the list of job offers by categories. I was able to find a way to finish the reducer function by **reading much of the Redux and Redux Toolkit documentation**, **reading some articles** I found on the internet, and **searching on google a lot**.

These are some fractions of code where I struggled and came up with solutions.

```
  const initialState = {
    isActive: false,
    roles: [],
    levels: [],
    languages: [],
    tools: [],
  };
```

```
  filterByRoles: (state, action) => {
      const { roles } = action.payload;
      
      if (roles.length > 0) return state.filter((joboffer) => roles.includes(joboffer.role));
    },
    filterByLevels: (state, action) => {
      const { levels } = action.payload;

      if (levels.length > 0) return state.filter((joboffer) => levels.includes(joboffer.level));
    },
    filterByLanguages: (state, action) => {
      const { languages } = action.payload;

      if (languages.length > 0) return state.filter(joboffer => languages.every(item => joboffer.languages.includes(item)));
    },
    filterByTools: (state, action) => {
      const { tools } = action.payload;

      if (tools.length > 0) return state.filter(joboffer => tools.every(item => joboffer.tools.includes(item)));
    }
  }
```

```
  const handleDeleteFilter = (event) => {
    const category = event.target.parentNode.firstChild.firstChild.data;

    dispatch(deleteCategory({ category }));

    dispatch(noFiltersApplied());

    if (!roles.includes(category) && roles.length > 0) dispatch(filterByRoles({ roles }));
    if (!levels.includes(category) && levels.length > 0) dispatch(filterByLevels({ levels }));
    if (!languages.includes(category) && languages.length > 0)
      dispatch(filterByLanguages({ languages }));
    if (!tools.includes(category) && tools.length > 0)
      dispatch(filterByTools({ tools }));
  };
```
